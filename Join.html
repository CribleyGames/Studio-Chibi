              Thumbnails are an important part of Studio Chibi and the first
              impressions of a video is always the thumbnails. Since XK isn't
              very good at making thumbnails he is hiring a content creator to
              show new people who studio chibi are. The requirements are:
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>&bull; Can convert images and artworks into PNG's easily.</p>
            <p>
              &bull; If you are considering of being a thumbnail artist, you may
              be asked to also make promotional posters to be shared throughout
              the community as well.
