              Studio Chibi is now launching their second project. This Year is
              15 years since thatgamecompany has been founded and XK wants the
              community to celebrate all of the amazing achievements of the
              company by making a video to show all of their achievements.
              This is XK's most ambitious project since the Rewind.
